        <p>
            At ICAEW managers and employees were wasting time in their day trying to find people who may not even be
            working that day. There was no clear uniform way to quickly track if an employee was absent, on holiday,
            training or working from home. This created confusion and wasted precious time that could have been better
            spent on projects that were of a high priority. Myself and another apprentice were tasked with completing
            an Out of Office application to solve this problem. It was our first company project and we would have to
            plan, design, develop and maintain the application ourselves.

        </p>

        <p>The Project team consists of:</p>
        <ul>
            <li id="list">1 Product Owner</li>
            <ul>
                <li id="list">Has a vision of what he or she wishes to build, and conveys that vision to the scrum
                    team.</li>
            </ul>
            <li id="list">1 Project Manager</li>
            <ul>
                <li id="list">The project management role is one that is designed to help ensure that the software
                    development process works
                    as it is intended.</li>
            </ul>
            <li id="list">1 Scrum Master</li>
            <ul>
                <li id="list">Manages how information is exchanged, runs the team and helps clear any blocked tasks.</li>

            <p style="font-size: 30px">Planning and Requirement Analysis</p>
        </center>

        <p> I found this phase very interesting as it allowed me to gain insight into the inner workings of the company
            and exposed me to the software development lifecycle. Myself and another apprentice began by meeting with
            the product owner and informed about our developer roles on the project. The high concept problems were
            presented to us and together we asked questions to better understand what the client wanted. I began with
            enquiring about the app functionality and what data we would need to collect from users. The client wanted
            users to be able to book holiday and anything relating to being out of the office through the app, as well
            as letting other users see which of their co-workers was absent. After our initial enquiries we agreed that
            we would need to have a login system, employee tracking, users grouped by their current work teams and
            approvers to validate any time off requested.
        </p>

            <p style="font-size: 30px">Defining Requirements</p>
        </center>

        <p> After all the meetings and conferring with the scrum master, we constructed a list of requirements that
            would serve as the scaffolding for our overall project. This included things such as “Access and Display”
            that focussed on the front end and initial login. The functionality of “Making Requests”, specifying how
            users can interact with the site through the UI, the varying amount of time they can book off and receiving
            automated emails. I also noted information that we collected for approvers, and what their abilities would
            be such as who can be an approver and selecting the different request types they can approve. We covered as
            much as possible with our documentation, to ensure that we produced the best possible product in an
            effective and inclusive way for everyone involved. Using the requirements, we created small easy to digest
            tasks that clearly reflected the work and the time required to complete them.
        </p>

                style="width: 700px; height: 300px;" /></center>

        <p>
            Together with our product owner we estimated that the work should be completed in four months. The third
            quarter of 2018 would be our deadline to create a fully functioning and tested application. These were my
            tasks for creating a meaningful dashboard. Most of these were primarily to do with HTML, Jquery and
            Fetching data.
        </p>

        <center><img src='https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/i8MJaJlbMOeWVictSUorTLADdgr0Kni4ClXvdihL1KtyLGmxWkSsjJPtBLfA4gfkQihmxGxQd3ux2T6AWGZJVJw8ZEnW57gvgGdpY7laNV0SJkUow3W1fLNA_nbK5APQAJLHZ2iFhQ=w2400' /></center>

        <p>
            Throughout the project we used burndown graphs such as this one, to convey how much time had been lost due
            to uncompleted tasks. This allowed us to have a clear visual representation of how well we were
            progressing, whilst creating an underline sense of urgency to finish work in a timely manner. As you can
            see in this graph, we were on target but in the last few days of that sprint some tasks were added. These
            tasks were tester related and were created to resolve raised bugs that I will reference later on.

            <p style="font-size: 30px">Designing the Product Architecture</p>
        </center>

        <p> The next step was the Design phase where myself and the other apprentice worked on the basic flow and
            structure of the application. This allowed the team to collectively see how the app would work and what the
            happy uninterrupted paths were. The diagram below highlights all the key directions the user could
            potentially take when requesting time out of the office. It helped to show what parts of the application
            that are crucial for a user to progress with their request. Examples of this are the login section to know
            which user is currently applying for requests. The manager that is currently working to function as the
            approver for that team. If the users wanted to cancel or edit a request, creating a new request and whether
            it even requires approval.
        </p>

        <center><img src='https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/QjADncksmVDpZgUL11KrHMoKGOFe0SKk9y7jljLiT9Rusc4EoSE9twBtE52bFH_3XNWcdhGdj1byd-fhhyV331TFQnYfaKkkh_kZLunp_hT3DZJYM_inmJ5hWMQlzGVMnLvQpR5HGQ=w2400' /></center>


        <p>

            This highlighted what information we would need to collect from the user, helped us to create the tables
            and stored procedures in our database. While providing the team with a clear visual representation of how
            the application will function at a basic level.

        </p>
        <p>
            I took on the tasks for the front end of the application, which was coded using HTML and Jquery. I began by
            designing the layout of the landing page that users are initially directed to on paper. This included the
            style, colour coding, separation of events and information to be included within those events. I
            highlighted how different requests will have statuses that indicate if they are approved or waiting to be
            approved. I included clear indications If the event is a full day out of the office, AM or PM absence. Even
            at this stage we were planning click functionality to allow users to right click on events and have a
            context menu for quick tasks. This included going to the pending request page to see which events were yet
            to be approved and making a request directly on the calendar, instead of going to fill out a request form
            on a different page.

        </p>

        <center><img src='https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/_7LKKYYGge2IXHAuL-uFYaEpDIGFxgI2OU_6AEW6L14B8DnvitZdXHL8QWaj40k-pqapzJWYQYSktgJmp-TnB69PV8HEr9lEIaNKcuA9cjI7G-Jzuqp7NY3NiymaCqytldpa0lCqog=w2400' /></center>

        <p> I presented this design to the product owner and the other developer and took on board the comments that
            they provided. I added the standard company header and logo, then the contact page. Next the company CSS
            (Cascading Style Sheet) was added; It is used on all the applications to create a uniform brand. I included
            the functionality of switching between a day, week and month view of the calendar. This is the layout that
            we elected to use:
        </p>

        <center><img src='https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/bK8jdpLLGF-9WQ60UBEuNktBQUozmzAFWWsi-aTpcw-xnIxMpUsfDOiTDaBPa7bDxCXPr8wQnvo8mBPOOv0OdgKbikM0CihiQOe5L_bmg_J4_SSlFoGtWgZLhv3DG8gCG6T5g1WZhw=w2400' /></center>

        <p> When designing the app, we decided to split the users into their ICAEW teams because it would make the
            calendar less cluttered and easier for their team leader to manage. Some employees within the company, have
            tasks that heavily rely on other workers before they can be completed. These uncompleted tasks can
            potentially cause bottlenecks and stall progress which costs us time and money. The most common of these
            bottlenecks come from waiting for testing, database issues and help desk tickets (Errors raised by users
            and employees). We recognised this and included the ability for a few select users to filter other teams’
            calendars, as well as their own. After checking the calendar, users can see if any key employees are not
            available that sprint, and then decide which current tasks would take priority.

            Database
        </p>
        <p>
            Myself and the other developer worked together to create the database for the application. We each chose
            the sections we would create for our separate tasks; we regularly checked in with one another to ensure
            that our work was uniform and up to ICAEW standards. With the information and notes I previously gathered
            from the happy path diagram, I created the table for the user’s absence requests. This included selecting
            which fields could potentially be null (have no input data from the user) and which fields must include
            input data.
        </p>

                style="height: 500px; width: 650px;" /></center>

        <p>
            Once we had our tables, we created the CRUD stored procedures that would function as our way to populate
            the database with all
            the required information from users.

            <ul>
                <li id="list">Any added information from the user.</li>
            </ul>
            <li id="list">Availability Status</li>
            <ul>
                <li id="list">Is the user available to work? Holiday would be no. Training no and Working from home is

            <ul>
                <li id="list"> Who approved or declined the request.</li>
            </ul>
            <li id="list">Review Date </li>
            <ul>
                <li id="list">The date it was approved or declined.</li>
            </ul>
            <li id="list">Reviewer Comment </li>
            <ul>
                <li id="list">Any additional information from the approver. Potentially a reviewer could specify why
                    they declined a request e.g.
                    “That date is unsuitable for you to be out of the office as this is an important release date and
                    we require you to oversee
                    the work”.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Including the “Last Modified By / Last Modified Date” fields allowed greater traceability for our requests
            as we could determine how recent the request was made, when the last edit was and who approved it. The next
            step was designing the other tables that would allow us to separate users into clear, easy to define groups
            and teams. The first table was simply called “User” that contained information about that employee, such as
            their name, email and job position. In the table was also their Id which was a primary key and unique to
            every user. The next table was “Team” and I linked the job position from the first table as a foreign key
            in this one, to assign employees to their respective teams. Individual teams also had an Id and was done to
            allow me to easily filter through them on the calendar.
        </p>

        <p>
            Entities and Data Access
        </p>
        <p>
            The other developer setup the base data access layers and the database connection. I created the access
            layers specific to the work that I was doing with the requests. I utilised the connection and linked the
            stored procedures that I had previously included in the database to this absence request command
            repository.
        </p>

        <p> Each repository in the data access layer will have a corresponding interface which will then act as a
            contract for the repository. Each of the repositories will also inherit from the BaseRepository which will
            contain the basic methods needed to complete the CRUD functions. By including the interfaces within the
            projects, it then means that the code does not need to be duplicated for each one meaning that development
            time can be saved and fewer mistakes are likely to happen. This is the beneficial to the business because
            it means that less time needs to be allocated to the physical development of the project, mistakes are
            easier to fix and less likely to occur, meaning a lower risk of deploying broken code out to the users and
            if something needed changing then it would be easy to substitute the code into a single place rather than
            have to deploy it out to every instance where it is used and produced.
        </p>

        <p>
            This provided the application with a link to insert parameters to create requests on the client side, that
            we could store in the database tables.
        </p>

        <center><img src='https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/2Hpv2_Bg-Qq4XrEJ2gx1wanU5KzMuDhj3s5WVHZhuRYK8d9l6JVwwwMxdYtLehhKW-TIfDOG2FwscGRe0UQzJ3uwphPTzf72xjEJ8wWzct5eTFxB6s36Zyvfi6SCNlf9Or1r-wzNgw=w2400'
                style="width: 550px;" /></center>

        <p>
            I initially sketched out the basic layout of the program architecture and how the entities would overlap
            into different sections of the app. Information would be needed from the database to be displayed to the
            web views and the entities are how we transfer that data.
        </p>
        <center><img src='https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/cDm0rBQcaFIvlKMSgHKAxpitZO9XDKAfWmiMjtqJr2VIwGB4fP0kH03AjGhwBQ6W0BfQCR1ZB-ZePd6Al_7UVBqwKZLLIG0Zyo9LLPZ2yDZoGuk-IQdl_eho6eeHYPejkyj5JGNifA=w2400'
                style="height: 600px; width: 500px;"></center>


        <p>
            There was a section of code that is required to data map the information from the database into the
            calendar. The application worked perfectly with the code stepping through the entities individually,
            picking up the data we needed. The issue appeared when the users increased to more than ten because we did
            not account for scaling. The method that I implemented took far too long to return any data for the
            request. The limit for loading was set to 15-20 seconds, and the current search was taking well over two
            minutes. This was unacceptable and would prove useless in the long term as the company employs well over a
            thousand people, which would break the application. I resolved this loading issue by changing the method to
            step through a single entity, instead of jumping to different entities and wasting time.
        </p>

        <center><img src='https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/bbTfTOmD4xdwAL_rU3dO6d1U3xGHcPmqjFKNDZ11HLY5-Iytsmo0fqqgfSSjCzi16p0RDpzhIvj6Sul043GlVoE0yTdnE-TmYDY3pC1y2X3dxJG07b4vDuXiRMMV_wojGJRSKNI9DA=w2400'
                style="width: 550px;" /></center>

        <p>
            I created a new entity called “Calendar Event” that was a collection of elements from all the other
            entities and only returned the specific information we required. This significantly reduced the loading
            time and retrieved the information in a much more effective way, that in turn was less taxing on the
            processing power. The entities carry the data through the application from the database to the web app and
            the web service.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once we could access the data, we populated the calendar with the events. Here is some of the Jquery logic
            below.

        <p>The http get request goes into the web API which then accesses the database and returns the information
            under the parameters we searched for. In this case the User Id is already stated because the user is logged
            into our app so that field will be automatically populated.
        </p>

        <p>The Get Team Absence Request method is fired and the dates that correspond to the date range selected by the
            user on the calendar will feed into this call.</p>

            In the screen shot below, the “var result = response.data” variable is where the information is returned
            and captured after it has been retrieved. We can then use this data and filter through it, to separate
            information such as teams and request types to produce our individual events on the calendar.

        </p>

        <p>

            Each individual request was labelled as an event and the information could then be filtered into week,
            month, day and team Id. This could easily allow users to transition between a calendar populated by events
            for holidays if they wanted to book off time of their own; and working from home events to see which
            employees are unavailable to speak in person. The HTML that links with this Jquery filtering and allows
            users to refine their calendar searches is also below.

            After many sessions going back and forth with the product owner over the style and layout of the page, this
            is the end result.

            I stuck to the guidelines I was provided with and created a view that corresponded with the ICAEW
            standards. Here is another view when users select the week filter tab.

            <p style="font-size: 30px">Testing the Product</p>
        </center>
        <p>

            Once we pushed our work into the team repository the testers began to go through each page and see what
            elements could potentially fail and cause bugs. The first one that was raised was users were able to select
            a start date in the past and create a valid request. Also, in the same failure the tester spotted that the
            users start date could be after the end date. This was a simple fix of implementing some logic that limited
            the user to only select start dates past the current date, and if the end date is less than the start date
            it will throw an error.

        </p>

        <p>The next problem was the calendar that we elected to use clashed with the CSS we used. The calendar
            primarily stores events as bars, that are then placed in the box that represents the date of the event. The
            issue appeared when multiple events were stored in a single day. Instead of appearing as a bar of ellipses
            and leaving the box the same size, the box stretched vertically to fit every single event inside it. The
            image of this occurring is below and we were unable to fix this issue within the time frame but that is in
            the section for future improvements.
        </p>

        <center><img src='https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/8pVSellKtvd5l7F9-3hMJAjvqwx8L2YV33xG0zKUrfpxbaD_kFcRQNcvGYRNXAVJyTzXYxsk8Fj_hyniSy-cSjlNolSt5z3FDJHyZO3J2ckKtuOKXEaZkOmoi_RzUFxe-lwyYhut4Q=w2400' /></center>

        <p>One of the testers made himself a part of three teams to observe how the system would behave and he could
            indeed view other teams’ calendars. The issue was that because he was overlapping into other teams, the
            calendar duplicated events and showed them all on the same calendar. The system could not distinguish
            between the duplicates so it produced them all for every team. This is another issue that we are planning
            to fix for the future; the application is currently being used for a single team so this problem does not
            affect us at this time. Going forward when the application is released for the entire business, this will
            be one of the first issues that is addressed.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another issue highlighted by the testers was the context menu didn’t direct you to the correct invite. When
            users right clicked on a specific request, it linked them to the pending request page or just the most
            recent invite. I found that the specific Id for the absence request wasn’t going to the right place. I was
            unable to get the Id to parse into the view and attach to the link when the specific event was clicked. I
            spent a lot of time on these issues but they were hindering the overall application completion time. I
            corrected some of the other issues in the context menu such as directing users straight to the create
            request page. Unfortunately, I couldn’t finish the specific event redirection so this task was also placed
            in the future fix section.

        </center>

        <p>
            I completed all the major tasks I was set and the work was approved to be pushed up to the server. I gained
            a lot of experience with SQL, HTML, C# and the visual studio environment throughout the development of this
            application. If I had more time, I would have liked to have finished the work on my context menu as I feel
            it would have made the page more streamline and user friendly. I thoroughly enjoyed the independence I had
            with the project, even though we had some guidelines to stick to. My input and ideas were taken on board by
            the team and if there were ever instances where I had suggestions that were unable to be implemented; I was
            told why that particular idea was not feasible. These instances were primarily cosmetic and were unable to
            be implemented due to our tight time constraints. I learned a lot about the software development life cycle
            and how to be a more agile developer. My personal skills were developed and enhanced in line with business
            processes. This was due to the adoption and engagement with agile and scrum methodologies, integrated with
            a variety of scenarios key to creating a working product.
