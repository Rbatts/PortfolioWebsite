      <p>
         I was tasked by my manager to teach something new to the IT team at Icaew. I decided to present a short
         session on a language
         called Markdown, with the goal of providing everyone with an easy to digest guide on how to use it. I started
         by learning the
         syntax myself and how to use the language effectively. I was very surprised at how quickly I picked it all up
         and how quickly
         you can implement it on GitHub. It was perfect for our requirements and I found it very enjoyable to use
         whilst I was preparing
         for my session. I created small examples of the syntax and wrote blocks of code whilst I was giving the
         presentation to highlight
         how easy the language is to use.

      <p> I demonstrated writing in visual basic (above) and directly on the Azure portal dashboard (below).</p>

         I saved and shared the documentation I created as well, which contained all the basic syntax in case anyone
         required it for later
         use. I wanted the team to start using Markdown to create simple Readme files for our applications. The focus
         was on this area because
         many of our apps have very generic names and it has led to some confusion at times. If the team used
         Markdown to add a short description
         onto the bottom of our repositories, solutions and files, it would save co-workers time. The ReadMe files
         provide context and insight
         into what the project entails without having to open everything and read through the code in its entirety.

      <p>
         I explained how you can directly type Markdown on the Azure portal and Github Read Me sections which is then
         automatically converted
         into HTML. It became apparent that everyone could easily learn the language and effectively apply it to the
         familiar systems that they
         already frequently use.

      <p>
         Many of the team have experience creating interactive and detailed websites. I tried to explain that Markdown
         is not a replacement
         for HTML because it is very limited and doesnâ€™t apply any style or unique mechanics to a site. I felt like the
         presentation was a success
         and I had very positive feedback from the team.
