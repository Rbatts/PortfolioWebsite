                Another recent application that I have been working on is called FDW (Finance in the Digital World). The brief for this project 
                was to create an application where non-members could be sent a link to access specific services on our website, that are normally 
                paid for. Third party companies could then purchase links for their workers, so that they could utilise our services and increase 
                their knowledge. 
         </p>
         <p>
                ICAEW have customers that pay a subscription to become members and they already have login details to access all of the services 
                we provide. If a link was redeemed by an individual but they were already a registered member with our company, they would simply 
                login using their credential. This would then in turn not redeem the link as they are only spent when a user is not currently a 
                paying member. 
         </p>
         <p>
                The initial planning phase for this project was much less formal than my previous out of office application as Invites was a much 
                smaller task. A short meeting was called where myself and two other developers were given the brief and we discussed what we thought 
                the best approaches would be. Epics and stories were created for the main sections of the application, along with the tasks and time 
                to complete them. Work was divided up amongst the different members of the team and I put myself forward to work more on the back-end 
                sections. I wanted to gain more experience working with the data and the service clients and I thought this would be a great 
                opportunity for me. 
         </p>

         <p>The Project team consists of:</p>
         <ul>
         <li id="list">1 Product Owner</li>
         <li id="list">1 Project Manager</li>
         <li id="list">1 Scrum Master</li>
         <li id="list">3 Developers - My Role</li>
         <li id="list">2 Testers</li>
         </ul>
         <p>
                I took on the task of allowing the application administrators to create guids. A guid is a Globally Unique Identifier and the format 
                is a well-defined sequence of 32 hex digits grouped into chunks of 8-4-4-4-12.
         </p>
         <p> Here is an example of a guid - <span style="color: red;">F6CD405A-0A3C-4AA6-86CB-2F38656D4825</span>. 
                It is sent to users within a link that gives them access to our website. Without it the website will lock and ask the user to enter one. 
                This secures our site because even with this unique code, they will still be asked to register with us or enter their 
                credentials if they are already a member. So, there is no possibility of an external user gaining access without being invited by us. 
         </p>
         <p>  
                The first steps were similar to the out of office application where I created tables and CRUD stored procedures for the invites and invite 
                profiles. This included information such as <span style="color: red;">“Invite Profile Id”, “Max Uses”, “Current Uses”, “Reference Guid” 
                and “Expiry Date”</span>.  
         </p>

         <p>
         My next task was to read the remaining uses for a guid and output that data as a bar with a percentage. I linked the View Model with the 
         entities from the Invites application so I would have access to the data. Then I created this action result to read the data and return 
         it to the view.
        </p>

      <p>
            Once I had the data in the model, I parsed it into the view and created this foreach loop so that I could step through each guid and 
            work with the values. In this case the values from <span style="color: red;">“Max Uses”</span> and <span style="color: red;">“Number 
            Used”</span>. As long as Max Uses was more than zero the code would run and perform the calculation to read out the values as a percentage. 
      </p>

   <p>
        This code also checked whether a guid was active or not to reveal which ones were no longer redeemable. I included this feature to show when the 
        maximum number had been reached but also to provide administrators with the ability to deactivate guids if there were any underlying issues with them 
        in future. Pictured below is the finished view with all of the bars and CSS applied effectively.

        Here is also the view I made to allow administrators the ability to create new guids and set the maximum values.
