        </center>
        <p>
            As a part of my role as a software developer, I have the responsibility of resolving tickets raised by our
            users. When working
            on service now I open small tasks that can vary in their seriousness and importance. I usually deal with
            small tasks that users
            are facing and spend time fixing the bugs that may have arisen. This falls under the maintenance section of
            the software development
            life cycle and is a necessary part to all of our applications.

        <p>
            The example I have chosen is a user being unable to login to their account. It’s a simple problem but it
            can cause a large
            amount of stress for our users, especially around exam release dates. The initial ticket simply stated that
            a user was unable
            to login, even though there were no mistakes with their credentials.
        </p>

                style="width: 800px;height: 400px;"></center>
        
        <p>
            I attempted to login on behalf of the user with our admin proxy ability and after some testing on my side
            of the application,
            I discovered that the user had duplicate accounts.
        </p>
        
        <center><img src='https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/eoxAV8zDzKPiLz_zDLjZe-9zKUnOsBH7xg4NrGg43P_cIDdnO2NXa5jQMQZBgHtyYnQeDjJxvFoMVnbBVY-zuhjJn0Z-knWR0Cdb9w4acpQvu6EILT-NuA4kZ3XZ3H7WWv2LWHblyA=w2400'
                style="width: 800px;" /></center>
        
        <p>
            After confirming the duplicate email in our database, I updated the error ticket and notified my superiors.
            The system had
            saved two instances of the single user with two separate email addresses, and this caused the database to
            set them both as
            active, then the system locked as it can’t distinguish which account it should use. I made a simple SQL
            query to find all
            registered users with duplicate emails and grouped them together so I could find the one I was looking for.
        </p>

                style="width: 800px; height: 400px;" /></center>
        
        <p>
            The old pro and cold fusion systems allowed duplicate emails to be used, but the new system restricts
            access if it occurs.
            This was an unforeseen oversight from previous iterations and was an uncommon, but never the less
            disruptive issue. I notified
            the user about what happened and confirmed that multiple emails were entered when they were first
            registering. I deactivated
            the duplicate and made sure the other remaining account granted access to the site. I documented the error
            for future reference
            and I closed the ticket due to everything being resolved.

            <p style="font-size: 30px">Exam Payment Error</p>
        </center>
        <p>When a user registers with us or attempts to pay for one of their exams, there is a very rare error that can
            potentially occur.
            It is where a user has received confirmation of their payment, my database will show the user has completed
            payment successfully
            but our finance team doesn’t receive all of the information about the user’s exam booking in their
            database. It may be due to a
            high volume of traffic, network issues or authentication difficulties.
        </p>
        <p>A user enters their bank details and purchases an exam. The request goes to a payment system, (World Pay/
            Western Union) which then
            checks if the bank details are correct. Once this is done, they accept the payment and send the
            authentication to our system. The
            “Request Log” then reads all of the information but if it fails for any reason or if the user is lost when
            being directed, it won’t
            update the users “Workflow”. This then leads to the finance team only having a sum of all the payments with
            a single Id and will lack
            all of the information such as “Exam Date”, “Exam Location”, “Product Code”, “Subject Description”,
            “Subject Code” and “Product
            Description”. All of these are crucial because without them, we are unable to generate a detailed invoice.
            Many users’ exams are
            funded by their companies or firms and the invoices are evidence that we acknowledge their payment.
        </p>
        <p>
            Also, without all of the information, finance won’t be able to send the LPD (Learning Personal Development,
            responsible for
            booking and registering users for exams) team the exam request details, and the user will not be registered
            for their exam.
            This is devastating for the company’s reputation and is unacceptable, so a check is run by finance every
            single day to pick
            up on irregularities such as this one.
        </p>
        <p>
            The check was run where an issue was found and I was asked to scan the database payments by running the
            specific query you see below.
        </p>
        <center><img src='https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/8b6sCirpLY-jYDu6clxqnMejTSiys_g9D--Q_IAHM59fjnjr5NxsrtMF_lTkeFa8tiRBwDgC7SUdu8Sp4ckJTOcP3PI3Ji_ypEP33DGshdyyeYp0hhOHoqDxI1CsKvoUkc4yBeYgCw=w2400'
                style="Height: 600px;" /></center>
        <p>
            This query will identify the missing payments in full detail as a JSON file, which I then used to extract
            the specific information
            needed for the finance team to book their exam.
        </p>
        <p>
            Then I entered this into a Microsoft excel document manually, so that I could send it back to the finance
            department. They can then
            update their own systems, as it is clear the user has indeed paid for these exams but the confirmation
            failed.

        </p>
        <center><img src='https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ch7r_pqkpopMyaqQdWcU8-RIsN_6ZjNhmFc6EI2rHCMxMNpHQNpuqtQ3U4rJSymPwiFEvMLDoQO7E0En1E-mE-NWrx0y7frzyu0j3i-MCWH0Cy7JH-y7suQqKqMikoGDDuyAlA3MpA=w2400'
                style="Height: 200px; Width:800px;" /></center>
        <p>
            The finance team then added the users details manually into their system and forwarded the update to the
            LPD team. This
            error is yet to be resolved with a permanent fix, so it is crucial that these checks are regularly
            performed.
