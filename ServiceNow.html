        As a part of my role as a software developer, I have the responsibility of resolving tickets raised by our users. When working 
        on service now I open small tasks that can vary in their seriousness and importance. I usually deal with small tasks that users 
        are facing and spend time fixing the bugs that may have arisen. This falls under the maintenance section of the software development 
        life cycle and is a necessary part to all of our applications.

                The example I have chosen is a user being unable to login to their account. It’s a simple problem but it can cause a large 
                amount of stress for our users, especially around exam release dates. The initial ticket simply stated that a user was unable 
                to login, even though there were no mistakes with their credentials.

                I attempted to login on behalf of the user with our admin proxy ability and after some testing on my side of the application, 
                I discovered that the user had duplicate accounts.

        <br>
        <p>
                After confirming the duplicate email in our database, I updated the error ticket and notified my superiors. The system had 
                saved two instances of the single user with two separate email addresses, and this caused the database to set them both as 
                active, then the system locked as it can’t distinguish which account it should use. I made a simple SQL query to find all 
                registered users with duplicate emails and grouped them together so I could find the one I was looking for.

        <p>
                The old pro and cold fusion systems allowed duplicate emails to be used, but the new system restricts access if it occurs. 
                This was an unforeseen oversight from previous iterations and was an uncommon, but never the less disruptive issue. I notified 
                the user about what happened and confirmed that multiple emails were entered when they were first registering. I deactivated 
                the duplicate and made sure the other remaining account granted access to the site. I documented the error for future reference 
                and I closed the ticket due to everything being resolved.
