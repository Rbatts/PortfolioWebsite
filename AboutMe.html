            <p>I am a web developer apprentice that has only been coding for a little over a year at the time of writing this page.
                Before September 2017, I had no prior experience in programming apart from some basic HTML. Since beginning
                the Softwire course I have gained a substantial amount of coding knowledge and respect for the craft. I get great enjoyment
                from taking the skills I have learned throught my day and then implementing them on my own small side projects in my spare time.
                I have made a text-based video game that is currently at the third itteration and is still under development.
