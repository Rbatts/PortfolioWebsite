# PortfolioWebsite
---
### This repository is for my Softwire Portfolio.

I decided to choose a web site format because it conveys to the viewer that I can
competently use HTML and display my portfolio content at the same time.

It also allows the person reading through my portfolio to have a more interactive
experience than just reading down yet another long piece of work. I feel that 
separating the work into easy to digest and manageable  chunks, is much cleaner
and more engaging.
